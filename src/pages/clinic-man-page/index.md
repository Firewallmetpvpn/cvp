That's crazy, that's ridiculous. You know what? Uh, why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone, attention in the office please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead. 

Oh good! I'll be your first customer! I think that fate put this catalog in my hand, yeah. Me neither. Yes. Ah I feel like an idiot. Awesome, yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.

Bears do not... What is going on?! What are you doing?! Does Mose have nightmares? Stay below the smoke line! Let's go! Clear out! STAT! ... Stat means now! To keep secrets from my computer, I miss the feeling of knowing you did a good job beacuse someone gives you proof of it. 'Sir, you're awesome, let me give you a plaque! What? A whole year has gone by? You need more proof? Here is a certificate.' They stopped making plaques that year.

I'm gonna miss Toby. He had a nice calming presence in the office. Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kind of cute, Jan made me breakfast this morning. Well, she bought the milk... It's soy! Thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny... in a good way.
