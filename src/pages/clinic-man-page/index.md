  whatWeDo:
    title: How it helps you
    description: In our interviews with attorneys specializing in CV, we’ve identified a number of stages in the CP process that could be aided with a bit of custom software. At this stage, we’re designing this software with specifically CV legal clinics and the attorneys that donate their time in them in mind.
  impact:
    title: Current stage
    description: Modern software development practices dictate that the product be released in stages, each stage adding features. This means that we’ll be putting something in your hands with limited capability long before we provide you with the tool that does all the things we believe it can/should do. We have not yet made this initial release. That said, there is tremendous utility in your engaging with us now. To make a good tool we need to put ourselves in the shoes of its potential users, which we can only do once we get to know them! You may either be able to connect us to attorneys who have participated in a clinic in the past, intend to do so in the future, or you may fit the description yourself. At this point we’re speaking with people like that in order to better understand their experiences, expectations, and to test our mockups and prototypes.
