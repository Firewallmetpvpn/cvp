  description: We are reducing barriers faced by formerly incarcerated individuals by streamlining process of vacating eligible convictions in Washington state. We analyzed the process of conviction vacation in Washington state, and have identified opportunities to use technology to streamline the process. Our efforts at the National Day of Civic Hacking on September 21st focused on automating eligibility calculation for conviction vacation. We see future opportunity to streamline the completion of the required forms. We are investigating the feasibility of a Turbo Tax style interface to simplify this process, and then e-filing the forms in counties where it is permitted.

  description: While the need for social justice is not news to anyone, the many forms injustice and excessive punishment comes in can be surprising!  While there are already countless organizations chipping away at some aspects … we’ve found those previously convicted of crimes …. Unsympathetic community relegated to life-long millstone… over and above the punition meted out by the courts…

  title: Expectations
  description: The way we engage is more regular than one might swoop in, knock out some tickets, and swoop out. We engage regularly, not just through our respective skill-sets, but with the team and project as a whole! This commitment amounts to, on average, about three hours every week for at least six months.
